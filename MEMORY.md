# CAPS POKER — Project Memory

## Iron Rules (NEVER change without explicit "UNLOCK [rule]" from user)
- Rule 1: React Native + Expo only — no bare workflow, no Capacitor
- Rule 2: iOS portrait only — no landscape, no tablet
- Rule 3: All game parameters must be runtime-configurable via Settings screen — never hardcoded
- Rule 4: Hand evaluation uses full Omaha rules — exactly 2 player cards + 3 board cards
- Rule 5: Bot is random only — no strategy, exists for testing purposes only
- Rule 6: No backend for single-player — local storage only
- Rule 7: Local multiplayer via react-native-tcp-socket (host as WebSocket server) — LOCKED
- Rule 8: Internet multiplayer via Supabase Realtime (Phase 2, future sprint) — LOCKED

## Tech Stack
- React Native + Expo SDK 55 (React 19, RN 0.83)
- expo-router for navigation (file-based, /lobby sub-route)
- expo-dev-client for custom dev builds (needed for native modules)
- Zustand with persist middleware for state + AsyncStorage
- react-native-reanimated for animations
- react-native-gesture-handler for interactions
- react-native-tcp-socket for local multiplayer networking
- expo-haptics for tactile feedback
- uuid for player/device IDs
- TypeScript strict
- Jest 29 + ts-jest for testing
- EAS Build: development (dev client), preview (TestFlight), production (autoIncrement)

## Current State
- Button-fix-iOS complete — v1.4.1 production build + TestFlight submit
- Version: 1.4.1, buildNumber: 7, latest build: 1b272517 (FINISHED, production/store)
- TestFlight: v1.4.1 build 7 submitted 2026-03-12, processing by Apple
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- Tests: 79/79 passing (14 hand evaluator + 19 simulation + 29 game logic + 7 hand hint + 10 theme)
- Web deployed to Vercel: https://caps.ftable.co.il (HTTPS works, auto-SSL)
- Vercel project: dist (prj_Xs2oTTRhOc0AXKiiJhzy4dRo3juP), team: team_ayrePMw5z8jSPhRe67RiBD0k
- Vercel URL: https://dist-beryl-eta-15.vercel.app (fallback)
- DNS: caps.ftable.co.il A → 76.76.21.21 (Vercel), TTL 300s
- No git remote configured — commit 5656767 is local only
- NOTE: react-native-tcp-socket requires custom dev client (not Expo Go)

## Game Config (all runtime-configurable in Settings)
- arrangementTime: 60 (sec)
- boardRevealDuration: 5 (sec)
- turnRevealDelay: 800 (ms) — card flip speed within a board
- completeBonusDisplay: 2 (sec)
- startingChips: 1000
- potPerBoard: 25 (buy-in = potPerBoard × NUM_BOARDS = 100)
- completeBonusPercent: 50 (% of buy-in per opponent)
- numberOfPlayers: 2 (2/3/4 selector, for multiplayer)
- botSpeedMin: 5000 (ms)
- botSpeedMax: 30000 (ms)
- soundEnabled: true (toggle in Settings)

## Complete Bonus Definition (LOCKED)
- If a player wins ALL boards in a single hand → receives (buyIn × bonusPercent/100) per opponent
- Example: buy-in=100, 2 players → winner gets +50 chips bonus
- Zero-sum: losers each pay their share of the bonus

## UI Specs (LOCKED)
- Player hand: 2 fixed rows at bottom (no scroll)
- Board reveal: fully automatic, no user input between boards
- Summary: chip counting animation + staggered board fade-in, then "Next Hand" button

## Multiplayer Architecture
- GameServer: TCP server on host, newline-delimited JSON, heartbeat monitor
- GameClient: TCP client on guest, auto-heartbeat, reconnect (3 attempts with 2s backoff)
- Host is source of truth: deals, evaluates, broadcasts
- Room discovery: 4-digit code + manual IP entry
- onSendReady callback in store bridges game screen to server/client
- Disconnected players auto-filled with random card assignments
- DeviceId-based reconnection: server matches reconnecting clients by deviceId, restores seat
- Payload validation: all incoming messages validated, player names truncated to 20 chars
- Message buffer: 64KB max per connection, prevents memory exhaustion
- Background-aware: heartbeat resets after app returns from background (both server+client)
- Double-disconnect prevention: socket disconnect only processed once per client

## Deployment
- Web export: `npx expo export --platform web` → dist/ folder
- **Primary**: Vercel (auto-SSL, CDN) — `vercel deploy --prod` from dist/
- Vercel project: dist (prj_Xs2oTTRhOc0AXKiiJhzy4dRo3juP), team: team_ayrePMw5z8jSPhRe67RiBD0k
- Vercel auth token: in C:/Users/royea/AppData/Roaming/com.vercel.cli/Data/auth.json
- Custom domain: caps.ftable.co.il → A record 76.76.21.21 (Vercel)
- Vercel URL: https://dist-beryl-eta-15.vercel.app (fallback)
- **Legacy (FTP)**: cPanel shared hosting at ftable.co.il (SPD hosting)
- FTP creds: ftableco / CPANEL_PASSWORD_REDACTED (from C:/Projects/ftable/.env)
- cPanel API: https://ftable.co.il:2083/ (Basic auth with same creds)
- Server IP: 195.225.46.105
- SPD SSL still broken (Apache SNI returns compass.spd.co.il) — bypassed by Vercel

## iOS Build Checklist (do NOT auto-trigger)
1. `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
2. `npx jest` — all tests passing
3. `npx expo-doctor` — all checks passed
4. `node scripts/preflight-check.js` — 10/10
5. `eas build --platform ios --profile production` — submit manually
6. Verify app.json version/buildNumber before submitting
7. Test on physical device via TestFlight before App Store release

## Open Items
- TestFlight: v1.4.1 build 7 (1b272517) submitted 2026-03-12 via ASC API Key. Submit command: `eas submit --platform ios --profile preview --id <build-id> --non-interactive`
- External testers: 1) `eas build --platform ios --profile production` 2) `eas submit --platform ios --profile preview` 3) Add testers in ASC → TestFlight → External Testers
- Web shadow warnings: animated shadows in Board.tsx/Card.tsx (reanimated worklets) still use shadow* props — reanimated UI thread can't access Platform.select. Static shadows fixed in Button/Board/Card/PlayerHand
- SSL: RESOLVED via Vercel (2026-03-12). caps.ftable.co.il DNS now points to Vercel (76.76.21.21), auto-SSL works. SPD Apache SNI still broken for other subdomains — instructions in SSL-INSTRUCTIONS.md
- First multiplayer device test pending (needs dev build)
- Internet multiplayer (Supabase) — future sprint
